# Module: monitoring_logging/wandb/experiment_tracking.py

## Functions

```python
def track_experiment():
    """
    Track an experiment using Weights & Biases (WandB).
    
    This function initializes a new WandB run, trains a RandomForestClassifier on a dataset,
    logs the accuracy to WandB, and optionally saves the trained model to WandB.

    Steps:
    1. Initialize a new W&B run with project configurations.
    2. Load dataset and split into training and testing sets.
    3. Train a RandomForestClassifier on the training data.
    4. Predict on the testing data and calculate accuracy.
    5. Log the accuracy metric to WandB.
    6. Optionally save the trained model to WandB.

    Parameters:
        None

    Returns:
        None
